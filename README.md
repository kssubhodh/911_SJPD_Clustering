*	Built a machine learning pipeline using Python, applying K-Means clustering and Random Forest classification to analyze 770,000+ 911 calls and predict crime priority levels with 78% accuracy <br>
*	Utilized Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn for feature engineering, data preprocessing, and model evaluation, driving actionable insights from large-scale crime datasets.<br>
* Developed geospatial heatmaps and cluster visualizations, identifying crime hotspots and temporal trends to optimize resource allocation for law enforcement.
